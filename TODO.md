# WordClock TODOs

- [x] Update packages to resolve "incompatible with dependency constraints" warning.
- [x] Change time rounding logic: round down to the nearest 5 minutes (e.g., 4:16 -> 4:15, 4:14 -> 4:10).
- [x] Add four minute indicator dots in the corners to represent the additional 0-4 minutes.
- [x] Style unlit letters more visibly (outline or grey) instead of nearly invisible.
- [ ] Optimize Web load time (investigate font loading, renderer, etc.).
- [x] Implement a Settings Page (color schemes, logic toggles?).
- [ ] Create a script/tool to generate new clock faces/grids from configuration.
